## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Utilize ImageDataGenerator for effective data augmentation, preparing datasets for training, validation, and testing.
  
- **Model Architectures:**
  - **VGG16-based Model (`cnn_model`):** Transfer learning with VGG16, customized for weather forecasting.
  - **Custom CNN Model (`model2`):** A custom-designed CNN architecture.
  - **Transfer Learning with VGG16 (`model_t`):** Utilizes VGG16 as a feature extractor.
  - **Transfer Learning with ResNet152V2 (`model_res`):** Uses ResNet152V2 as a feature extractor.

- **Training and Evaluation:** The models are compiled using the Adam optimizer and trained over 20 epochs. Training history is visualized for each model, and the models are evaluated on a separate test set.

- **Data Augmentation for Forecasting:** Includes an example of data augmentation applied to a sample image for forecasting purposes.
